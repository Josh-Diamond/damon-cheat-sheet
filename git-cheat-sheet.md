## Git Cheat Sheet

First time only - Initialize repository with the following steps:
1. Initialize your repository and link it to github
`git init`
2. Next, we will configure and name the "master" branch, this may be any name you pick, but industry practice is moving towards "main" or using "master" is still a common professional practice. You will only need to do this step ONCE per github account. (so don't repeat unless you make a new github account)
`git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>`
